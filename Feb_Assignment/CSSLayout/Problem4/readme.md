Week 2

I create a new page which is "About" to introduce myself.

For style.css,
Class person is for style of background image and navigation bar.

And class about is for about page.

Also class education is for educaiton page boxes. Class educationpage is for the rest content about bu transcript and the introductions of my undergraduate school.
Unfortunately, I had some problems creating this page.
I didn't attend Saturday session at first. I code the css and html the way I want. I mean I didn't use the grid at first. So I meet some troubles when i want to solve media queries.
I asked my frident told me that the professor told this in record. So I find that i should use grid to implement media queries after seeing the record.
